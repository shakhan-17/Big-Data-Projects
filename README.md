# Project Title: A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE COLD START PROBLEM IN RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

## Overview
This repository contains projects related to Big Data, focusing on recommender systems and addressing the cold-start problem. The projects leverage collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization techniques to enhance recommendation quality.

## Project Stages

### 1. Project Inception
- Define the problem statement: Addressing the cold-start problem in recommender systems.
- Formulate research questions: Explore leveraging auxiliary information, effective ML techniques for new users, and evaluation methodologies.
- Define methodology

### 2. Data Collection
- Utilize the MovieLens Latest Small dataset, encompassing ratings, movies, tags, and links.
- Merge relevant datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### 3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
- Explore dataset statistics and visualize key insights.

### 4. Collaborative Filtering
- Implement collaborative filtering techniques to generate user-item recommendations.
- Evaluate using appropriate metrics.

### 5. Content-Based Filtering
- Implement content-based filtering leveraging item characteristics and external data.
- Evaluate using relevant metrics.

### 6. Matrix Factorization
- Employ matrix factorization using the Surprise library for collaborative filtering.
- Evaluate and compare with other techniques.

### 7. Hybrid Filtering
- Develop a hybrid recommender system combining collaborative and content-based approaches.
- Evaluate and compare performance.

### 8. Results and Analysis
- Present and analyze the results of different recommender systems.
- Address research questions and draw conclusions.

### 9. Documentation
- Document the project methodology, code, and results.
- Provide a comprehensive README file.

### 10. Future Work
- Discuss potential enhancements and future directions for the project.
